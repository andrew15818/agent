# Chess Playing Agent

This is an LLM-powered chess playing agent. The idea is to practice Agents based on a game that I like. 
The agent should generate some commentary(a-la [chess.com](chess.com) bots) and the next move given the currently played moves.

This should be a multi-agent system, since we will need one agent to calculate the best move given the list of moves,  generate some quirky commentary,
and anything else we can come up with.
