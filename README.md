# Chess Playing Agent

This is an LLM-powered chess playing agent. The idea is to practice Agents based on a game that I like. 
The agent should generate some commentary(*a-la* [chess.com](chess.com) bots) and the next move given the currently played moves.

The project relies on [langchain](https://www.langchain.com/langchain) to coordinate the agent and tool calls.
